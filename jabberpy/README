jabberpy  0.1 README Matthew Allum <breakfast@10.am>

Introduction
-------------
Jabber is an Open Source project to provide an XML based cross platform
instant messaging solution. 

For information about the Jabber project visit http://www.jabber.org.

'jabberpy' is a Python library to allow the easy creation of Python
programs, such as clients,  that use the Jabber Instant Messaging 
protocol. Its sourceforge url is;

  http://sourceforge.net/projects/jabberpy  

Whats Needed
------------- 
You need python >=2.0 with the expat modules installed. You can check
for the expat modules by opening up a Python shell ( make sure it 
reports at least version 2 ) and enter 'import parsers.xml.expat' . 
If you get an error you need to install the python expat libs... 

To do this;

For Debian users;

You need the python2-base package installed, then as root;

apt-get install python2-xml

From Python source (Un*x);

Before compiling Python, have a look at the file Modules/Setup in the
distrubution directory. At the bottom of the file you'll find some 
instructions for installing the expat modules, follow them !

For Windows Users;

AFAIK the windows Python Binary ( from python.org ) comes with expat 
support included. If you are using windows see the 'notes' section at
the bottom of this readme.  

Installation
-------------
From the untared distrubution directory; As root run;

python setup.py install

Alternatively just copy XMLStream.py and Jabber.py to somewhere in your
PYTHON_PATH. 

The included test_client.py script is a simple command line Jabber 
client written using the library. This client will also run strait from
the untarred distrubution directory.

Documentaion
-------------
Unfortunatly little documentation exists currently. I suggest having
a look at the jabber protocol docs ( from jabber.org ) and the source
code for test_client.py     

Notes
------
<> The library should run fine on windows. Unfortunatly the test 
   client will not as it 'selects' on a file handle and 
   windows does not support this. If anyone knows a workaround
   for this please inform me.

<> The library currently supports most of the 'base' Jabber protocol
   - messages, presences and iq's. With 'helper' functions for 
     authentication, rosters, registration etc.

<> A Mailing list for the development of the jabberpy project is 
   available at;
