Jabber.py 0.01 README

This requires >= Python2.0 with the xml librarys installed.

If you are running debian as root;

apt-get install python2-base
apt-get install python2-xmlbase

You can run test_simple from untared directory or if you have distutils 
installed , as root, execute  

python2 setup.py install

to install in your proper lib directorys.
